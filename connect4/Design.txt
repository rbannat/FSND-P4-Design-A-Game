What additional properties did you add to your models and why?

To implement Connect4 I added rows, columns and moves to the game model representing a Connect4 game with the number of
moves being made as well as a flag for a canceled game. I added a Disc model representing the moves of a player
inserting a disc into the board. Its properties are the column and row it has been inserted to and the player who played
the disc.
Also I added a GameHistoryEntry model representing a move being made during a game with game, column(move), result and
timestamp as parameters to show the whole game process.


What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

Implementing the new game logic with the ai as opponent was quite tricky.
I decided to only enable playing against ai for now, but replacing the ai with real players won't be difficult.
Also it needed to be checked whether the game is over (board is full or player wins or ai wins) after each move by
player and ai. Using the query filters was challenging because of the many restrictions concerning inequality.
